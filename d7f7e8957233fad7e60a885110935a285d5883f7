      "message": "Why not return a boolean ? The LookupProvider will reply with whether or not it is interested in identifying spam numbers.\n\n\nIf it is getSpam*(), then we are asking a LookupProvider to identify a Provider that wants to know about spam which breaks the abstraction of a LookupProvider. It would have been a valid method on a LookupProviderManager or sth akin to that.\n\n\nThe LookupProviderImpl in vendor/extra will always return true to spam reporting as long as there is a valid provider - the settings db check. And if and when we do have multiple plugins that only satisfy a subset of the CallerInfoProvider contract we can provide a more accurate answer to the \"supports spam?\" query.",
