      "message": "Currently, the clients of this class (like ImportVCardActivity and NfcImportVCardActivity) already perform a check on the number of accounts to determine whether or not to call this class to disambiguate the account of interest. That is a contract that I would like future uses of this class to adhere to.\n\n\nIf for some reason, someone does call this class in the presence of a single account, it might be better to go through the usual flow and do something implicit behind the scenes.\n\n\nAs far as the size check, though this shouldn\u0027t normally happen, I left that bit of code in there as a fail-safe.",
